# Measure_Transport

We study how to sample from complex probability distributions using Metropolisâ€“Hastings based methods, enhanced by heuristics inspired by measure transport techniques.  
This idea is motivated by the works of Marzouk and collaborators, see for instance [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05023) and  [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5492).

The work has been carried out during MATH-414 at EPFL, Stochastic Simulation.
